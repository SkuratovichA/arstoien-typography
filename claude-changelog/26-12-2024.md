[Initial Setup] Set up a TypeScript project for a typography component with the following:
- Initialized pnpm project with package.json configured for library development
- Configured TypeScript with the latest version (5.9.3) using strict settings
- Set up Biome.js for linting and formatting instead of ESLint and Prettier
- Created project structure with src directory for components, hooks, utils, and types
- Installed necessary dependencies including React, markdown processing libraries (remark, rehype, unified), and styling utilities (clsx)
- Created Typography component with editable blocks similar to Notion
- Implemented markdown import/export functionality
- Added support for various block types: paragraphs, headings, lists, code blocks, quotes, dividers
- Created useTypography hook for state management with minimal re-renders
- Set up build configuration with tsup for both CJS and ESM outputs
- Created comprehensive demo application with 6 different examples:
  - Basic usage example
  - Markdown import/export example
  - Custom styles configuration example
  - Read-only mode example
  - Interactive editor with controls
  - Performance test with multiple blocks
- Integrated i18next for internationalization in demo app
- Added Vite configuration for running the demo application
- Configured proper TypeScript types and exports for library usage

[Bug Fixes and Improvements]
- Fixed package.json exports configuration to properly order "types" before "import" and "require"
- Fixed TypeScript strict mode errors by adding proper null checks throughout the codebase
- Fixed cursor positioning issue in editable blocks by implementing local state management
- Updated Vite configuration to use .mjs extension for ESM compatibility
- Improved TypeScript type safety with proper undefined checks in array access
- Fixed the text input issue where cursor would jump to the beginning by maintaining local content state during editing

[Critical Cursor Fix]
- Completely refactored TypographyBlock component to fix cursor jumping issue
- Implemented proper uncontrolled contentEditable pattern
- Removed local state management that was causing React to replace DOM content
- Now only sets content when entering/exiting edit mode, not during typing
- Browser now handles cursor position naturally without React interference
- This ensures smooth typing experience with cursor staying at correct position
